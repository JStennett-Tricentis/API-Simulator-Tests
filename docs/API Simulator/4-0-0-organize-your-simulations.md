# Organize your simulations

The Simulation registry page is a list of all the simulation files you have uploaded to Tosca Cloud.

To open it, go to API simulation > Simulation registry in the menu bar on the left.

The page shows the following information:

- The name of the simulation file.
- The date and time when the simulation file was created.
- The date and time when the simulation file was last modified.
- Which components the simulation files contain. These can be the main elements connections, services, runnable services, resources, or includes.
- Tags that you've added to your simulations. You can use tags, for instance, to sort or filter your simulations.

The Simulation registry page.

You can search for simulation files or click the column header to sort columns in ascending or descending order.

If you want to create custom filters for your simulation files select .

## Upload simulation files

You can upload a simulation file from your local machine to the simulation registry if you have already created one. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the upper right corner of the Simulation registry page, click Upload file.
2. Choose the simulation files you want to upload.
3. Click Open.

## Create new simulation files

You can create new simulation files directly in the simulation registry.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the upper right corner of the Simulation registry page, click Create service.
2. Select Edit to leave the read- only mode.
3. Enter a name for your simulation in the Simulation File field.
4. Optionally, enter one ore more tags into the Tags field. Confirm each entry with Enter. You can use tags, for instance, to sort or filter your simulations.
5. Define the content of your simulation.
6. Click Save.

Create simulation file.

## Deploy simulation files to Simulator agents

After you have uploaded or created simulation files, you can deploy these files to a Simulator agent that is connected to Tosca Cloud and run them there.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the checkboxes to choose which simulation files you want to deploy.
2. Right-click and select Deploy from the context menu.
3. Select a workspace and an agent from the respective lists.
4. Click Deploy. This starts the simulation on the Simulator agent.

## Edit simulation files

If you want to extend or modify a simulation, follow these steps:

1. Click on the simulation file that you want to edit.
2. Select Edit to leave the read-only mode.
3. Make your changes and click Save.

## Download simulation files

You can download your simulation files from Tosca Cloud, for instance, to archive them. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the Simulation registry page, use the checkboxes to choose which simulation files you want to download.
2. Right-click and select Download. This automatically creates a zip file and saves it in File Explorer under Downloads.

## Remove simulation files

To remove a simulation file from the simulations overview page, right click on it and select Delete from the context menu.

If you want to remove multiple simulation files, select the simulation files via the checkbox next to the files. Then click the delete icon in the top menu bar.
