# Use the Simulator agent as proxy

With the Simulator agent acting as a proxy, you can intercept and redirect the traffic between a client and a real service. The proxy allows you to parse, filter, or forward requests to a virtual version of the service. This lets you simulate, test, or monitor the service without the real service being available or affected. The proxy also helps isolate different test environments and provides flexible control over traffic flow. For example, you can use a proxy to simulate parts of your website when you don't want to use real data.

## Start the Simulator agent as a proxy

To make the Simulator agent run as a proxy, follow these steps:

1. Start the Simulator agent to open its interface.

2. Go to Settings > Proxy.

3. Select Start. The proxy port is set automatically.

## Stop proxy

To stop using the Simulator agent as a proxy, go to Settings > Proxy in the Simulator agent interface and select Stop. Alternatively, simply close the Simulator agent.
